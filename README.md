# Checkers
- This is a two-player checkers game.
- It is built off of an array that stores the board state and updates it whenever something moves.

# Features Missing
- ~~King Pieces still cannot double jump~~
- ~~King pieces can move on both turns~~

# Bugs
- I have squashed all the ones I have found so far, so none at the moment
